1. This project utilizes generators to create a sequence that calculates Fibonacci numbers on demand.
2. A closure can be used to store the state of the sequence (previous two numbers).

3. The generator function yields the next Fibonacci number each time it's called, avoiding calculating the entire sequence upfront and improving memory efficiency, especially for large numbers.

 

Software development is all about problem solving, and I believe you now understand the problem, it's time to come up with a suitable solution. 

Now that you have a solution and you also have a basic lazy fibonacci sequence generator, let's improve on it.

 

CACHING MECHANISM

1. Implement a cache within the closure to store previously calculated Fibonacci numbers.
2. The generator function first checks the cache for the requested number.

3. If the number is not cached, it calculates it using the traditional recursive approach and stores it in the cache for future use.

4. This optimization improves performance for repeated requests of the same Fibonacci number.

 

We now have a powerful tool right there.

Let's make it more powerful. 

 

USER-DEFINED RANGE

 

1. Modify the generator function to accept a starting and ending index as arguments.
2. Instead of yielding numbers indefinitely, the generator iterates only within the specified range.

3. This allows users to retrieve a specific portion of the sequence without calculating the entire thing.
